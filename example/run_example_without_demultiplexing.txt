Let's check acceptable mismatch levels.
1.1 mismatch in indices.
2.2 mismatches in barcodes, 1.1 in ROIs.
4.4 mismatches in neCP1;
2.2 mismatches in neCP2.
2.2 mismatches in mCP1
For library 37-44 8.8 mismatches in mCP2;
1.1 mismatches for mCP3.
For mapping control 8.8 mismatches for mCP2;
1.1 mismatches for mCP3.
Minimum read count for normalization sample is 3.
Minimum read count for expression sample is 0.
